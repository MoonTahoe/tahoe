BeerJS Tahoe
============

BeerJS Tahoe is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around AngularJS and the MEAN stack, but in reality the scope is pretty open. The meetup will usually follow a beer socialization/forum format. Anyone can present for any amount of time.

Want to share something?
-------------

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.

Submit a Pull Request, file an Issue, or edit the Wiki.


Want to bring beer?
-------------

Of course you do.  Those with beer will be given priority seating ;)
