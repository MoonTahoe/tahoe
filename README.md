BeerJS Tahoe
============

BeerJS Tahoe is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around AngularJS and the MEAN stack, but in reality the scope is pretty open. The meetup will usually follow a beer socialization/forum format. Anyone can present for any amount of time.

We are now also an official <a href="http://famo.us">Famo.us</a> meetup.  Famo.us is the only JavaScript framework that includes an open source 3D layout engine fully integrated with a 3D physics animation engine that can render to DOM, Canvas, or WebGL.  Come on up and learn about this killer framework.


Want to hang out?
-------------

We meet on the 3rd Wednesday of the month at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/12242+Business+Park+Dr,+Truckee,+CA+96161/@39.316106,-120.148205,17z/data=!3m1!4b1">The Lift Co-Working</a> space in Truckee, CA. It's on the second floor of the Airport Office Centre on the left. Huge thanks to The Lift for giving us a home in the community.

And what is BeerJS without a beer sponsor.  Truckee is fortunate to be the home to <a href="http://fiftyfiftybrewing.com/" title="Fifty Fifty Brewing">Fifty Fifty Brewing</a> and now so is BeerJS Tahoe.  Fifty Fifty will be supplying our beer!  Be sure to stop by and support them (try the Eclipse Barrel Aged Imperial Stout).

Want to share something?
-------------

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.

Submit a Pull Request, file an Issue, or edit the Wiki.


Want to bring beer?
-------------

Of course you do.  Those with beer will be given priority seating ;)


The Community
-------------
I just started a G+ community for us: TahoeJS. I figured we need a place to be social... whatever that means.  I think we can post questions and discussions on TahoeJS to share it with our community.  I also created a organization in github for us named TahoeJS.  Please let me know if you want to be apart of it and I will add you.  I will have a better logo real soon.

By the way, did you hear about the out going developer?  He looks at others people's shoes when he talks to them ;)
