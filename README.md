BeerJS Tahoe
============

BeerJS Tahoe is a time to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.
Topics so far have been around AngularJS and the MEAN stack, but in reality the scope is pretty open. The meetup will usually follow a beer socialization/forum format. Anyone can present for any amount of time. You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.
We meet on the 3rd Tuesday of the month at The Lift co-working space in Truckee, CA. It's on the second floor of the Airport Office Centre on the left. Huge thanks to The Lift for giving us a home in community.

Why Github?
-----------

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.
* Less spam
* Because Github is free and [Meetup.com is not](http://www.meetup.com/help/Does-it-cost-money-to-start-a-Meetup-Group), which means more beer money!
